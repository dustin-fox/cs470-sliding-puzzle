# cs470-sliding-puzzle
This project is meant to help me explore different search techniques used in artificial intelligence to solve a sliding puzzle.
The Sliding 8 puzzle is fully playable and it also incorporates the following 5 algorithms to automatically solve the puzzle:
1. Breadth First Search (no closed list)
2. Breadth First Search (with a closed list)
3. Depth First Search
4. A\* Search (using Manhattan Distance heuristic)
5. A\* Search (using Straight Line Distance heuristic)
